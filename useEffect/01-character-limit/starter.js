/*
  Instructions:
    Assume you're creating an app that allows the user to 
    post status updates (ala Twitter). Your UI should have a
    textarea and a button. The button should be disabled if the
    length of the textarea is 0 or greater than 240 characters.
    The document's title should inform the user on how many
    characters they have left to type before they hit the 240
    character limit - "115 characters left."
